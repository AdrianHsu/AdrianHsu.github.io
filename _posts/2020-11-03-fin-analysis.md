## Porter’s Five Forces

- Industry competition: Competition and rivalry raise the cost of doing business.
- Bargaining power of buyers: Buyers with strong bargaining power can extract price concessions.
- Bargaining power of suppliers: Suppliers with strong bargaining power can demand higher prices.
- Threat of substitution: As the number of product substitutes increases, sellers have less power to raise prices and/or pass on costs to buyers.
- Threat of entry: New market entrants increase competition and companies must develop new technologies and human capital to create barriers to entry and economies of scale.

## Business Metrics

### 0. [成長性分析] Growth

- YoY Revenue Growth
  - (This year - Last Year) / (Last Year) * 100%
  - also used on Operating Income, Net Income, EBITDA...
  - 公司若展現好的長短期營收成長率，則具備短期和長期成長動能（當然要避開一次性的賣土地或是資產的收益狀況）

### 1. [獲利能力分析] Profitability: important margins re profit

- 公司是否可以穩定獲利的依據

- Gross Profit (Gross Income)
  - Revenues - COGS
  - might be (1) Revenue outperform peer companies (2) COGS less than peer companies
- Gross Profit Margin（毛利率）
  - **Gross Profit / Revenue (or called Sales)**
  - 較適用於製造業，一般而言，製造業毛利率若能 > 20% 就算是不錯的表現，但像是一些網路、軟體公司和 IC 設計公司其研發費用佔的是大宗，營業成本不高，所以毛利通常會比較高
  - even if the gross profit is good, but you spend so much COGS → still bad
- Operating profit
  - Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
  - Operating Expenses: mostly SG&A  → generate operating costs for each sales dollar
  - NOPAT: Net Operating Profit after Tax
  - 營業費用包含了管銷費用和研發費用等，營業毛利真正扣除營業費用才是真正的本業獲利。
- Operating Profit Margin（營益率）
  - Operating Profit / Sales
  - 企業本業的賺錢能力依據，排除買別家公司股票的 unrealized gain 之類的可能
- Operating Expense Margin
  - Operating Expense / Sales
  - compare with peers
- Operating Income as a Percent of Sales
  - patent protection, create barriers
  - key factor to determining the operating profitability

- Net Profit / Net Income（淨利）
  - gross profit - fixed costs（業外損益（轉投資、買賣土地廠房收入）就是營業淨利，建議 > 10%）
  - i.e., Revenues - COGS - fixed costs
  - 尤其要避開一次性的賣土地或是資產
- Net Margin（淨利率）
  - **Net Margin = Net Income  / Revenue**

### 2. [獲利效率與槓桿分析] Profitability: ROA & ROE + Financial Leverage

- ROA

  - ROA = Net Income / Average Assets
  - Profitability (Profit margin): Net Income / Sales
    - 企業的獲利能力
    - 淨利率(稅後純益率)
    - 來自稅後純益代表產品競爭力佳
  - Productivity (Asset Turnover): Sales / Average Assets
    - hold the lowest level of assets → better
    - 資產使用效率高，則代表可以使用較少的資產創造更高的獲益
  - **Profitability-oriented v.s. Productivity-oriented**
  - Coca Cola: High PM, low AT
  - reflects (1) company performance
  - 企業運用資產賺錢的本事，一般認為 ROA 有 8% 的才算是表現不錯

- Financial Leverage

  - FL = Average Assets / Average Equity (A = L + OE)
  - 財務槓桿
  - relative use of debt v.s. equity
  - higher debt + interest payments
  - it is an inexpensive source of capital relatively (but more risk as debt)

- Solvency (償付能力) Analysis:

   Anaylsis of FL

  - Solvency refers to a company’s ability to meet its debt obligations
    - uses balance sheet data and assesses the proportion of capital raised from creditors. → e.g., L/OE Ratio
    - uses income statement data and assesses the profit generated relative to debt payment obligations. → e.g., TIE Ratio
  - Liability-to-Equity ratio: (L / OE)
    - 負債比率，金融業的會很高，因為收入來源是借貸產生的利息
    - conveys how reliant a company is on creditor financing compared with equity financing
    - variation: "Long Term Debt / Equity" (based on assumption: current liabilities are repaid from current assets. so-called **self-liquidating**)
    - c.f. Debt-to-Market-Cap Ratio
  - Time interest Earned (TIE) Ratio: (EBIT / Interest Expenses)
    - i.e., Interest Coverage Ratio
    - assesses how much operating profit is available to cover debt obligations.
  - Liability-to-Asset Ratio: (L/A) → less representative but still works

- ROE（股東權益報酬率）

  - Net Income / Average Equity
  - $1 EPS / $10 stock price = 10% ROE
  - ROE = ROA * (Financial Leverage)
    - 若 ROE 來自於財務槓桿則企業營運績效並不健全
  - ROE is higher → more debt, less equity (assets is given fixed) → bad
  - larger ROE means higher risk (higher reward/loss)
  - reflects (1) company performance (2) how assets are financed
  - 一家公司長期獲利表現最好的指標，投資人多半會希望一家公司過去 5 年的 ROE 可以大於 15% 或 > 10 %
  - Repurchasing shares will increase RoE (since that Shareholder's Equity decreases)
  - **拆解 ROE 可以透視一間公司的獲利能力、資產效率、還有財務槓桿。**

### 3.[週轉率分析] Productivity: Cash / Conversion & Capital Intensiveness

- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) (Merck proposed this)
  - CCC = Days of Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payables Outstanding
  - another way to analyze Productivity (like Asset Turnover)
  - DIO: average time to sell inventories
  - DSO: average time to collect A/R from the sale
  - DPO (minus): average time to pay the payables incurred for puchasing inventory
  - generally prefer "low" CCC → the operating cycle is generating profit and cash flow quickly (negative CCC is viewed positively)
  - Apple:
    - low DIO → carry little inventory as the products are pre-sold
    - low DSO → quick sales
    - high DPO →(p.s. it is negative) longer time to pay suppliers
    - CCC is negative = (73.6) days
    - Apple can invest the cash it receives from product sales for 73.6 days before cash is needed to pay suppliers
- Inventory Turnover
  - Inventory Turnover 存貨週轉率
  - Inventory Turnover In Days
  - 有些公司“不適合”用存貨周轉率衡量，例如**金融業、營建業**
  - 金融業是因為它們最大的存貨就是錢(像是銀行、保險業等)；營建業則是因為土地即為“存貨”，存貨高、存貨周轉率低很正常
  - “適合”用存貨周轉率衡量的公司有製造業、電子業、半導體業等等，這些公司只要存貨一跌價，就會損失
  - 零售業、百貨、網購這類企業也同樣可以用存貨周轉率評估
  - 存貨周轉率低：公司存貨過多賣不出去，銷售能力衰退。存貨周轉率高：公司產品銷售順利、經營績效好。
- PPE Turnover
  - PPE Turnover = Net Sales / Average of Net Fixed PPE
  - PPE Turnover in Days = 360 / PPE Turnover
  - higher PPE turnover = low capital intensity
  - should aim for "higher" PPE turnover (but is hard)
  - **High Capital Intensity v.s. Low Capital Intensity**
  - TSMC: low PPE turnover, high capital intensity
- Capital Intensity
  - Capital Intensity = Total Assets / Sales = 1 / (Asset Turnover Ratio)
  - higher PPE turnover = lower capital intensity
  - refers to the weight of a firm's assets—including plants, property, and equipment—in relation to other factors of production.
  - c.f. Labor Intensive
  - Apple and TSMC are Capital Intensive (high value)
- Asset Turnover Ratio
  - Asset Turnover Ratio = 1 / (Capital Intensity)

### 4. [高估或低估分析] Valuation Rank (Overvalued / Undervalued)

- **EPS**
  - (net income - preferred stock dividend) / WASO
  - $1 EPS / $10 stock price = 10% ROE
- **P/E Ratio (本益比)**
  - current market price / EPS
- **P/B Ratio (股價淨值比)**
  - current market price / book value per share
  - book value = Owner's Equity = A - L
  - 適用於資本密集公司，energy, manufacturing, financial business
  - e.g., 通常銀行會用 P/B Ratio 衡量，因為帳面上的 asset 比較明確。
  - 軟體公司不適合 P/B Ratio 因為很多 intangible assets (company's brand name, goodwill, patents, and other intellectual property)
- **Earning Multiples**
  - $10 stock price / $1 EPS = 10x Earning multiple
  - buy stock with high multiples!
- **EBITDA**
  - Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization
  - 倒著算回去，Net Income + I + T + D + A
  - firm's overall financial performance
- **Enterprise Value (EV)**
  - Market Cap + Debt (financial leverage) - Cash (idle cash)
  - Debt is a subset of Liability e.g., total liabilities = 230m, which includes 155m of debt
  - exclude the effect of financial leverage and idle cash
- **EV / Revenue**
  - helps compares a company's revenues to its enterprise value. The lower the better, in that, a lower EV/R multiple signals a company is undervalued.
  - often used during acquisition
- **EV / EBITDA**
  - helps compares a company's revenues to its enterprise value. The lower the better, in that, a lower EV/R multiple signals a company is undervalued.
  - a low EV/EBITDA ratio could mean that a stock is potentially undervalued
  - As of Jan. 2020, the average EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 was 14.20.
- **Dividend Yield**
  - Annual Dividend / Purchase Stock Price
  - depends on the price you bought

### 5. [流動性分析] Liquidity Analysis

- Net Working Capital (NWC，營運資金)
  - 了解公司規模多大，推斷規模經濟、市場佔有率
  - Current Assets (high liquidity assets) - Current Liabilities
  - relevant to Operating Cycle (Cash Cycle)
- Current Ratio 流動比率
  - Current Assets / Current Liabilities，越大越好
  - more commonly used than NWC (ratios tells more)
  - prefer higher Current Ratio
  - However, an excessively high current ratio indicates inefficient asset use
  - a current ratio less than 1.0 is not always bad
    - **Walmart**: A cash-and-carry company with comparatively fewer accounts receivable  can have potentially few current assets (and a low current ratio), but consistently large operating cash inflows ensure the company will be sufficiently liquid.
    - **Apple**: A company can efficiently manage its working capital by minimizing receivables and inventories and maximizing payables.
- Quick Ratio
  - Quick Assets (the quickest one in Current Assets) / Current Liabilities
  - Cash, Marketable securities, Accounts Receivable
- Free Cash Flow
  - Operating Cash Flow (Cash From Operations) - Investing Cash Flow (Capital Expenditures)
  - FCF > 0
- Free Cash Flow Yield (FCFY)
  - Free Cash Flow / Market Cap
- Free Cash Flow Margin
  - Free Cash Flow / Revenue

## Valuation Methodology

1. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

   - Income Approach
   - More free cash flow → more investment → grow more
   - Forecast the free cash flow of the company in 3-5 years, and also predice the growth rate for free cash flow.
   - Use discount rate to calculate Intrinsic Value
   - Market Value v.s. Intrinsic Value

2. Selected Public Company Analysis → 

   what I will use!

   - Public Market Approach
   - Determines the value based on a comparison of the Company’s financial performance to that of observed market values and multiples of publicly traded companies deemed similar
   - consideration size, growth, profitability, and outlook
   - Company’s prior year and/or estimated next year’s EBITDA, EPS, NOPAT...→ measure income and cash flow
